# accordion
## To-do:
* FInd good solution to content height changing mid transition causing incorrect end point and jumpiness at the end of the transition.
* Implement vanilla solution to jQuery data using weakmaps, the use that associate data rather than directly on DOM objects (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29222027/vanilla-alternative-to-jquery-data-function-any-native-javascript-alternati).
* Find better method for creating unique ids, only use ids for content wrapper beacause of accessibility, everything else should be referenced in data associations on the DOM or in weakmap.
* Implement scroll to top options.
* Implement callbacks.
